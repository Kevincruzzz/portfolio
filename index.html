          thrilled to have you here. I am currently studying on Grade 11 and I
          want to earn some for my needs. At 16 years old, I've had the
          opportunity to explore a wide range of interests and hobbies. One of
          my greatest passions is Programming. Even though its hard im doing it
          because I find it interesting to learn and Im preparing myself for my
          college degree. Its an integral part of who I am. I want to do some
          commisions not only to earn some money but also gain an experience for
          my future. So hope I satisfy you with what you need! </p>
